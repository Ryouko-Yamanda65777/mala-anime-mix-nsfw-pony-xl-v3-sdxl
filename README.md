# Mala Anime Mix NSFW Pony XL V3 SDXL

A text-to-image model based on **Stable Diffusion XL** architecture, fine-tuned for generating a blend of anime, NSFW content, and pony-themed art. This model is intended for advanced image generation tasks and can be used for producing high-quality and customizable outputs based on textual prompts.

## Features

- **Anime-inspired Art**: Capable of producing high-quality anime-style illustrations.
- **NSFW Content**: Includes NSFW capabilities for generating adult-themed content (ensure compliance with relevant regulations and policies before use).
- **Pony-themed Imagery**: Specifically fine-tuned to generate pony-themed art.
- **Text-to-Image**: Supports text-based image generation, making it accessible for custom prompts.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- **PyTorch (CUDA-enabled for best performance)**
- **Hugging Face Transformers & Diffusers**
- **Telegram API (for bot integration, optional)**

### Python Libraries

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install torch diffusers transformers huggingface_hub python-telegram-bot
```

Ensure that your environment is set up with the necessary hardware, such as a CUDA-compatible GPU, for optimal performance.

## Model Details

- **Model ID**: `John6666/mala-anime-mix-nsfw-pony-xl-v3-sdxl`
- **Base Model**: Stable Diffusion XL
- **Content**: Anime + NSFW + Pony-themed art generation

This model is available on the Hugging Face model hub. Ensure you have appropriate access rights to the model before using it.

## Usage

### Text-to-Image Generation

To generate images using this model, you can use the Hugging Face `diffusers` library. Here’s an example:

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch

# Load the model
model_id = "John6666/mala-anime-mix-nsfw-pony-xl-v3-sdxl"
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe.to("cuda")  # Use GPU for faster processing

# Generate an image from text
prompt = "A futuristic anime-style cityscape at sunset with ponies"
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]

# Save or display the image
image.save("generated_image.png")
```

### Telegram Bot Integration

You can also integrate this model with a Telegram bot. To do this, you'll need to:

1. Set up a Telegram bot via BotFather and obtain your API token.
2. Use the bot code template provided in the repository to create a text-to-image generation bot.

To run the bot:

```bash
python telegram_bot.py
```

### Example Bot Command

Once the bot is running, you can send text prompts to the bot in Telegram and it will return generated images based on the model.

## Limitations and Considerations

- **NSFW Content**: This model generates NSFW content. Be aware of the legal and ethical implications of distributing such content, and ensure you follow platform policies (like Telegram's) when deploying public services.
- **GPU Requirement**: Due to the model's size, it’s highly recommended to use a CUDA-enabled GPU for generating images. Running on CPU will be significantly slower.
- **Content Moderation**: If deploying publicly (e.g., as a Telegram bot), consider adding user consent mechanisms or content filters.
